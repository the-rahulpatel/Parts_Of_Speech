# Parts_Of_Speech

This is a simple text-based python program that utilises Claude's free API to identify parts of speech in a sentence in British English. 

# Usage

The user is asked to write a sentence in the CLI, however some context is added to maximise performance and produce accurate answers. The model then returns a strucutred block of text with each part of speech in the brackets placed beside each word.
