# Parts_Of_Speech

This is a simple Python GUI that utilises Claude's free API to identify parts of speech in British English. 

# Usage

The user interface allows the user to enter a sentence, and the model then processses the input with additional context in the prompt to maximise accuracy. Then, the answer is displayed onto the screen. 

# What I learnt
I have learnt to integrate system variables in python through 'import os', to undestand the importance of virtual environments, to secure my API keys when deploying this online, and to parse JSON in python. 

# Recent releases
