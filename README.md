# Parts_Of_Speech

This is a simple text-based python program that utilises Claude's free API to identify parts of speech in a sentence in British English. 

# Usage

The user is asked to write a sentence in the CLI, however some context is added to maximise performance and produce accurate answers. The model then returns a strucutred block of text with each part of speech in the brackets placed beside each word.

# What I learnt
I have learnt to integrate system variables in python through 'import os', to undestand the importance of virtual environments, to secure my API keys when deploying this online, and to parse JSON in python.
